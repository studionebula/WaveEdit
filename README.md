# Synthesis Technology WaveEdit

This is a fork to add some features, fix some problems, and (hopefully) get stuff updated to build on contemporary systems. Currently it builds only on Linux, thanks to numerous dependencies on out-of-date packages and compiler conventions. Original comments follow.


The wavetable and bank editor for the Synthesis Technology [E370](http://synthtech.com/eurorack/E370/) and [E352](http://synthtech.com/eurorack/E352/) Eurorack synthesizer modules.

### Building

Make dependencies with

	cd dep
	make

Clone the in-source dependencies.

	cd ..
	git submodule update --init --recursive

Compile the program. The Makefile will automatically detect your operating system.

	make

Launch the program.

	./WaveEdit

You can even try your luck with building the polished distributable. Although this method is unsupported, it may work with some tweaks to the Makefile.

	make dist
